# hello-world
Repository following GitHub's "Hello World" introductory guide.

my name is alexis, and i am a college student. i am majoring in computer science,
and i aim to work in the tech industry when i graduate. i hope that i can become a
pro at using github - especially since i kinda struggled with it while using it in
one of my courses - but i have to take things one step at a time. but you know what?
that is okay.
